          <h3>Personal description</h3>
          <p>I am a programming learner managing to grow as a front-end developer.
            My begginnings in this world of developing are not long ago, but I think I have learned considerably given that I have been self-taught. Hopefully I am going to get some bigger projects to work on soon.

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>I did not study anything related to programming, actually I am a Geneticist Biotechnologist graduated from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Peru and I worked as a biotechnologist for two years. Since I always wanted to learn about the programming field, I decided to self-teach myself with online resources and documentation.</p>

      <p>The prime reason why I am studying programming is because I always wanted to. Before I did not about how much I could be able to grow in this career, maybe in view of the fact that the popular beliefs about programmers I was sourrounded by. But, happily now I know the real facts. In the future I see myself working on big projects, enjoying them and, why not, maybe growing a start-up of my own.</p>
